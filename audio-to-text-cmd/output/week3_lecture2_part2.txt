okay so we're starting the second part of the review here
 I just wanted to break down the video this is that you're not confined to watching an hour or so of a video in one sitting so I was a previously mentioned the development of software and the process models that are used are not set in modified improved A demented different studies and implementations and some of them so the software engineering Institute is a research and development center funded by the US Department of Defense their stated purpose is to help others make a measured in proof fence on their software engineering capabilities there's also the international standards organization or ISO which determines the series of software quality standards Institute and I so greatly to assessing the maturity of an organization and their software development support
 maturity model or C NM initially proposed by a z I used to help a software for the station to find this level of maturity in software development the level of maturity of software organizations is determined by its practice of different sets of Key software development process activities the levels are sequential and a cumulative is that an organization assessed at a level elevated from level as smart as one that means that I was previously a level to you and before that I was at level want different levels are initial where
 I'm sorry levels for the first initial where you are the least mature than there is repeat Define optimizing and optimizing is where you are the most mature each level has an Associated number of key processes on organization must Master each of the processes are listed here on the side so in order for an organization to elevate from one level to another famous first Master the processes of the top level of an also be able to process is from the higher levels
 level of organization has no process and has probably experienced leader of an organization defines practices and continually improves on the different processes and moves up to scale to maturity to achieve all levels there are 18 key processes that must be attained both large and small companies around the world from India to China have attained level five maturities the United States of the organization's position is however just be utilized for self-improvement and never request any formal assessment
 in 2001 the CMM was upgraded to cmmi which is capability maturity model degraded by is to provide guidance for improving processes of an organization and its ability to develop manage and support the software products and services to cmmi there's a representation model which is more applicable to the assessment and Improvement of processes are applied to assessing the maturity of an organization in the case there are six zero through five levels for assessing the process areas the state's representation has 5 1 through 5
 notes that the names for the states
 besides both representations utilizing levels for assessment five major process areas covering four major categories within Process Management which has five processes there's also project management which has processes there is engineering with six processes and there is support with six processes the 25 process areas form the basis for the process evaluation and cmmi
 Outlast
 for the laugh, between both the continuous process areas is it doesn't need to set of specific that you need to satisfy the process area to each one of the goals of the five generic goals are listed here to see if that process across organizations institutionalize the defining is a process across the organization institutionalize quantity
 process across the organization and five institutionalize continuous optimizing or Improvement that process across the organization
 as far as the continuous model versus the stage model representation each process starts at capability level 0 and moves out the capability levels based on achieving the generic goals and a specific sub. This allows the organization to choose and pick the process to focus on based on the needs of the organization it also allows comparison of process area that process area between organizations easier migration from other standards for one and it allows easier comparison of organizations by maturity levels
 model in which each process areas appraised at its own level uses both the specific goals and the generic wheels for SS in the process area order for a process area to improve
 representation model there are five maturity levels the same process areas are grouped into four of the five maturity levels maturity level by satisfy the set of process areas that are grouped level n -1 the state's representation model provides an organization AC charge level appraisal based on the set of process areas that are satisfied
 end of things off we must look at process definition in communication in general the process model that you choose to work with is an abstract representation of the actual process it is important that this is modified process has well-defined and communicated to all participants so that the project can be carried out smoothly host of is composed of two basic parts in the project and choose the order in which these activities should be performed the following activities which will specify the necessary entry and exit criteria for each activity in which each one should be performed
 three artifacts the definition of all resulting output from each of the activities resources tools is number 5 which is having an inventory of the tools that may be used to enhance the performance of the activity so please understand that it is difficult and TDS to Define all of the preceding activities and related terms that was just discussed on the parts that are most relevant to eat now the team
 for the second lecture
 please make sure that you do watch the supplemental videos and you pay close attention to your homework assignments due dates if you have any questions concerns or comments you let me know
