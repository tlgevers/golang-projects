welcome to class this first week would you have to lectures that we're going to be going over so please do be sure that you make time to watch both of them we are starting off with a discussion about creating a program
 so at this point of your educational track at Athens State do you should be extremely comfortable with the concept of creating a program to do this to most of you will read over a problem statement that you're given think about it for a little while and then you need to come up with a solution on your own or you might go online to look up some references to assist you in getting started but it's okay I wasn't so I know how things work the area or some of us struggle with creating our programs is that of the logic behind it it's not that we can't figure out the C plus plus statements to you is because we have all had at least three people's Plus classes but it's actually thought we might have a hard time just determining where to start once we get past this hurdle we go ahead and start coding and when we run our program
 well it doesn't run because it didn't compile why we have are syntax errors are the ones that are easy to solve right because we're told what is wrong or at least give an idea of what may be wrong so we can fix it so many times when we write code we are not going to get it right hundred percent on the first try
 but then again our program will run but didn't give us the right output so then we probably have an heir with our logic being in this situation lost for us to learn other steps and coding it allows us to learn the. We need to test our code to pick up of those logical are we might need to rethink a problem maybe our logic is completely wrong or we may believe that we have the right logic as and we need to trace or debugger code so we can figure out what is causing the air either way it's the first thing that we are doing a programmer's is just sit at the computer and start cutting away some of the following was considered to be the developers simple reflex to approach
 finish first lecture as I mentioned we're looking at creating a program so for the most part that should serve as a review for most of you specially if you have reached that Comfort level when it comes to prayer to be able to go through and discuss the process of creating a program we're going to work with a given problem statement which reads give it a collection of lines of text strings stored in the fall short of an alphabetical order and write them to another file
 know if you can't already think of how you would do this and then you may be struggling with your logic I actually give a similar problem in my programming one class so I just didn't see a list of names and ask them to determine who's at the top and who's at the end based on alphabetical order ring so this is a problem statement to that you should all be able to comprehend pretty easily even though we're going to cover it as if it was something more complex if this was a more complex program there are two things that the problem statements would include there would be a set of requirements or specify what the program is to do and you may also have design constraints which determines how you were able to design the program when we develop programs outside of our classroom homework we are usually working for an organization or business of some sort
 I think of requirements from a business perspective we think of transactions that must absolutely take place when it comes to software engineering requirements can be negotiable since requirements can be negotiable in software engineering and not in business transactions we need to understand why when it comes to software engineering and creating a program they're going to be requirements that are needed for the program to work and they're going to be requirements that are nice to have but the problem was still work as it should without it requirements in software engineering also fall into the category of the functional witches what the program does and nonfunctional requirements which is the manner in which the program must behave so simple program
 what would be our functional and non-functional requirements take a moment and pause our lecture here and try to make a list you have to pause the lecture if not it will just continue because I don't pause the recording on my end
 are functional requirements describe what the program does in our case it's boarding of a file our non-functional requirements will describe items like performers usability and maintainability were these the same functional and nonfunctional requirements that you came up with the non-functional requirements are sometimes the hardest ones to determine something to help is to keep in mind is that non-functional requirements are sometimes referred to as the abilities because the words that most often described them and in bility examples of performance and security well these are exceptions to the ility
 modifiability usability configurability reliability availability and scalability
 set the timing on requirements is number one second is that will be given designs of strength the design constraints are going to tell us the ways in which the software can be designed and implemented so we're talking about things such as the choice of programming language majority of you would want to program in C plus plus I told you that in this class so you have to have the knowledge of java
 what platform the system will run on and what other systems will it interface with these are design most times when we were asked to create a program were already given the requirements because their clients know what they are looking for however there may be input and assistance from software Engineers that go into the requirements because there may be technical decisions that need to be made by the client may not be familiar enough with it to be able to make those decisions
 however you always want to know your requirements and you're his trains before you start project in the real world even after the project has started there may be changes to the requirements and the design constraints and that is where it really comes into play but we'll be talking about that later for now let's take a look at what to do the thinking process involves when it comes to functional requirements in relation to our simple problem and also design constraints
 so first we need to consider the format for the input data how will it be stored what are we considering to be a character for our problem we need to Define what separates the lines on the file this is actually critical because several different platforms may use different separator characters we also need to know the input character set is it one bites per character this is fine for any English and most Latin derived languages but Chinese or Arabic requires 2 bytes per character because they have more than 250 characters we can't assume that we would be creating this program for English or Latin derived languages so this would have to be specified as part of the requirement
 sorting we need to understand the actual meaning of story the Sorting mean that we sort in ascending order or descending order what happens with items on the list that have non alphabetic characters how do we store as far as the number do they appear before or after the letters are sorted what about lowercase and uppercase which one goes first or do we ignore capitalization sorting doesn't seem so simple anymore does it
 lastly we want to look at special cases boundaries and air conditions so as far as special cases
 what exactly is going to be taken into consideration what if they're empty line how we going to treat those what about is a file is empty so here we were thinking that a sorting problem is going to be pretty simple at least I was we might be reconsidering this. Right now and that is just the process for thinking about the functional requirements requirements
 well for the non-functional requirements remote look at foremast do we need to program to finish most or all of the input within a specific time frame if performance becomes an issue do the FAFSA. We do have a time constraint to work with this also means that the program must perform in real-time then we need to be sure that which is an algorithm with less than average performance if it has a better worst-case performance run Time Performance is going to be something that we discussed later so we're not going to spend it too much time on it now
 another non-functional requirements will be that of modifiability are we going to plan to modify this program at some point what is the life expectancy of this program will the program only be used once if that's the case then modifiability is not an issue however if we want to have this program working for 10 plus years then we need to worry about making it easy to maintain and modify what about use the end of the program can have different backgrounds which gives them a variety of strengths and weaknesses are interaction style considered during the development of the program lastly something that is bigger than ever now adays security both of the organization and developers of the software need to agree on security definitions that need to be derived from the business application goal potential threats to project to assets and management control to protect from moss and accuracy alteration
 the unavailability or misuse of data and resources all need to be thought about Security in the thinking process of non-functional requirements security can also be a functional requirement
 now that we have thought about are functional and nonfunctional requirements we need to think about design constraints and design decision the first design decision to consider is that of user interface should it have one should it be command line or graphical user interface should have be a web interface if we take into consideration the Sorting problem a web interface would not be our best option because users would have to upload the file and download the sort of file result and based on their internet connections there could be other issues second are the typical or maximum input sizes depending on the typical infant size remain want to spend different amounts of time on algorithms and performance optimization we also have to take into consideration the important when it comes to the algorithms that we have decided to use some infants are particularly good or bad with certain algorithm an important decision that falls along
 that is the business or organization that's the decision in which platform the program should run if there's not something already sentenced the best thing to do is to perform a cost-benefit analysis on whether supporting additional platforms is the way to go or not lastly there's always a deadline involved so it's important to make decisions on a schedule what are going to be your Milestones what are those deadlines the final deadline for completing the program software is going to come from the quiet of course there will be some input from the technical side of the house because the client must have a realistic time frame of mind there also needs to be
 consideration on feasibility and cost because these two things can also play a role on how scheduling takes place and as far as the design decisions were looking at two major components one is the sun in the programming language in which the program will be created with to make this decision there are other things that need to be considered this decision is not made on the thought this is what I'm going to use yes the experience of the developer with the language is taken into consideration but so are the programming needs and requirements of that program performance is also going to influence the second components which is the choice of an algorithm however whatever algorithm is chosen to be balanced with the effort required to implement it and the familiarity of the developers with it
 in addition to program requirements and design constraints we also need to be able to decide on testing testing should not only be done once your program is completed but you should be testing your program while you are the finding it developing aunt and once it is completed of course at times for simple programs may seem a little excessive however keep in mind that the ultimate realm is not that of a simple program however it is one of a much larger program for a business or organization with deciding when to test your program there are also different kinds of testing one is that of acceptance testing this test is actually done by the client and if it fails the client can reject the program all that effort and work done for nothing kind of like in my classes when I assign you with something and say that if there's a specific type of Arrow
 compile then your grades going to be an automatic zero there's no partial credit why because in the real world is there is also nothing as partially stuff. So it's important to make sure that testing a cars and anything that is not working as it should is fixed this also means that if your program has a warning you should fix it and not leave it there just because it's a warning and not an air as a developer of a program you will run tests that are considered to be for the purposes of verification and tests that are considered to be for the purposes of validation verification tests are done to determine if a program works and is correct validation test determine whether we have built the correct system for the client so
 I'll wait to see it at the at the following questions for verification you want to ask are we building the product to write
 for validation we want to ask are we building the right product
 when it comes to verification the most important test for developers to run is a unit test this is the process followed by a programmer to test each piece of software when writing code you should also be writing tests to check each module function or method that you have written there's also black box and white-box testing Black Box testing is where are you based your test cases on requirements specification only and not on the implementation of coat white-box testing is the opposite where you design the test cases while taking into consideration design and code implementation
 now that we've made the decisions for our requirements and design constraints and we know that we'll have to test whatever it is that we develop one must now determine how long everything is going to take remember the client will have a scheduled deadline in mind and that's the technical experts we as developers need to be able to provide guidance to the clients to determine if their deadline is realistic or not to be must know how long will it take us to perform estimating how much effort involved in creating a system program is one of the most important aspects of soft strap of a software project
 having an estimation of effort is required so that they can also be a cost estimate establish and as mentioned the schedule so there are four steps to follow to be able to determine your time and efforts first estimate how much time in Minnesota take you using your favorite language and Technology to write a program that reads blinds from one file and write some lines to another file of course here were using a simple problem as our bassist next assume that you'll be writing this sort routine yourself and we'll Implement a simple of graphical user interface your design should be represented like the one shown here you have two text boxes for providing to file names into buttons to navigate the system and locate your file and wear your outfit will then you will have a third button that will actually perform the sort of operation
 so here you should estimate your time to the nearest Minute
 even though it might be easier to come up with the random number there are things to take into consideration is the assumption that you'll be able to work straight through on this task with no interruptions realistic don't you need to go to the restroom maybe get something to drink when can you spend the time on this task if you were asked to do this task as soon as reasonably possible starting right now can you estimate when you would be finished think about this for a minute start to is to take these questions into consideration and be able to create a new estimate here even need to take into consideration the time that you will not be on task
 why would you not be on task well as mentioned you might need to drink you might want to eat you may want to sleep might have to go to the bathroom maybe there's a movie on TV that you really want to watch this coming out tonight maybe you have a family or significant other that actually wants to spend some time with you
 better yet maybe you have another class that you also need to work on
 so when we work with larger projects we are probably able to break them down into smaller top we can actually do that with the simple problem that we have remember how I mentioned that I might require you guys to know Java for the spa well the solution to our simple problem is based on Java however since you have all been through data structures you should still understand what I'm about to discuss job and even cplusplus were able to break down our simple problem how well we can create a class called string sorter with three public methods someone to read once a ride to and want to start there's an additional method that is called index of biggest this method is used within the Sorting routine are sorting algorithm involves finding the largest elements putting it at the end of an array and then starting the rest of the array using the same mechanism when you break things down and start to establish your time on completing each piece instead of everything at once
 how close is your estimation to what you had before did you have a specific formula that used to convert from ideal time to calendar Todd what date from today
 would you give a client at the delivery date for the program
 keeping track of the time you actually spend on each task as well as the interruptions you experience is a worthwhile data collection activity you can then compare these times with your estimates which can later assist you in estimating future Project X
 the expectation if you do this is that the estimates that you created are probably going to be inaccurate even want asks are well-defined project estimation and effort estimation are the toughest problems in software project management and software engineering one of the big problems with estimating is that it is conceptually performed during the bid for the job which is before the project that started in reality a lot of the development task and information possibly up to design is needed in order to be able to provide a good estimate the estimate was also be done by the people who are doing the job in other words the programmer to developer you you don't want to have a manager or someone else who is not actually performing the work estimating the time as they are probably not familiar with your schedule and when you may take breaks and go to work on other tasks
 play mine. No other projects you're working on and most definitely more than likely to don't know your pace so let's summarize in a simple stopped what we have gone through
 so we look at understanding the problem this is my retirement so we're making sure that we fully understand what are functional requirements happen to be in are non-functional requirements to perform in some kind of design based off of all requirements so we want to organize our functionality is it might create some diagrams that will assist us we want to focus on what the input and output what is the set-up of the data do we have specific formatting that we have to use we want to think about those constraints remember you know is this going to have a graphical user interface with how how can we design this and we definitely want to make sure that we understand algorithms that we have available to us to solve the problems and being able to select the best algorithm
 for the particular problem that we have at hand
 once you've done this time we start to join your photo and implementation so we start turning our design into actual code will probably be converting input and output some kind of a specific user interface or an input output format we have to determine what is the sequence that things will take place you know it's user has to be able to select a file first before we actually do any sorting to it we need to double-check our algorithms and then if required we need to figure out how to use the language Library properly
 our fourth step is going to be to verify and test the program so here we want to check that our results are correct so we're talking about going Beyond syntax errors if we have syntax errors
 how to program stop going to compile that's not what word what we're looking for here when we're talking about verification and testing
 we have a running program and now we're just wanting to run different data different input with it to make sure that we're receiving the ride to Output that we are. We are looking for so we need to be sure that we have our predetermined test cases and when we run through them we should be getting the output that we expect if not then we're going to have to debug our programs we will have to fix our programs and then we have to remember Sarita verify you cannot just pick something and then not run that test case against the only ones that you have ran through all of your test cases and you get all of your expected results from those test cases do you actually stop testing
 what's really going on when we're giving a problem to create the solution I do understand the problem the solution implemented code and then we start testing and based on the test your might have to tweak our code and then we test again however we may go back and forth between all these different steps based on decisions that we make or rethinking the problem changes to our code after testing me also require us to reconsider our design and all of this will need to be documented as part of our problem definition in program requirements
 once we have finished and everything test correctly we should revisit our estimates and determine the quality of our work revisiting our estimations and code will allow for us to be able to deter quality metric so we will look at how long actually took us to have everything done working correctly what was the effort that we put into it and total person hours does the solution that we came up with completely solve the problem that we were given and how good is the work that we have done the question with how good our work is can be challenging because there needs to be an understanding of how the word good as measured what is the metrics that will be used to be able to determine if the work is actually good
 for your homework please follow the instructions that are posted under assignment 1 in Blackboard part of the assignment is to complete a discussion board post I want you all to take time into considering a different simple problem this new simple problem weeds write a program a new favorite language that will accept numerical numbers as import compute the average and output the answer now for the purposes of the assignment your input and output should post be filed base so you'll be reading in files and you'll be riding to a file
 please be honest with your estimates when you come up with them via Simon does actually require you to ride out this program so you do have to do a little bit of coating it shouldn't be too difficult like I mentioned this kind of goes back to one assignment for programming one
 you will also have three discussion posts that you'll have to do and all of the specifics of those discussion posts are found in the assignment 1 instruction document
 just some answers that I have seen before so the two questions that are asked is how long in the elapsed time would it take you to implement the solution is how much overall effort will this take so as far as how long would it take to implement the solution have people that might say okay 10 minutes 15 minutes an hour now I will see you as part of the homework assignment that I didn't include in the previous slide is what was your solution match the problem and everybody pretty much just a 2DS and then how good will your solution was president when he wants to say that hey I got it you know this is going to be awesome I'm on point well part of the
 part of what you're going to have to provide is you're going to have to provide your explanation of what makes your work good so that would be something that you need to think about now realistically when it comes to real elapsed time for people raised between 46 minutes to 5 days. I had 10 minutes to 1 hour 10 minutes 15 minutes in 1 hour and realistically 46 minutes
 what's the shortest amount of time five days the longest most took somewhere between 1 to 3 hours as far as effort you're looking at
 40% minutes mostly between one person our two three person hours this way it came down to so these are going to be some of the things that you're going to need to think about for your for your assignment
 now before you're able to fully complete assignment wine you want to make sure that you also watch the next the next video I think I included some questions about complexity on on the assignment and that is something that we cover and in the next election when we start talking about building a system so if you have any questions concerns discussed here please please please make sure you ask questions send me an email let me know if it's a question that may benefit a lot of students to know the answer I will be sure to answer
 to provide the question and the answer on blackboard I will make it Anonymous it so people don't know who asked who asked a question so please make sure you watch the next the next video and again if you have questions just let me know
